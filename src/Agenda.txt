- Show application and what it does
- Show Server project - .NET Core, simple .csproj
- Show Client project - .NET Core + Angular, HowTo.txt

Server project:
	- Show wrong solution – AddNodeWizardControllerBad
		- 21: Steps hardcoded in wizard
		- 27: Static cache to cache data between requests
		- 55: Keeping track of position in wizard
		- 95: Direct DB usage
		- 128: Caching - DateTime not testable
		- 152: Creating plugin instances
		- 174: Reading and parsing files
	- Show correct AddNodeWizard controller
		- Dependency injection - describe what it is, why it's good.
		- Show that wizard is not doing anything, it just calls others
	- NodeService
		- Wraps node manipulation logic
	- NodeDAL 
		- Entity Framework - still good to wrap in DAL		
	- NodePluginProvider
		- IConfigurationProvider - abstracts configuration access
		- IFileContentProvider - abstracts files access
		- ICache - Time-related unit testing
	- Cache<T>
		- abstracted date time
		- Configuration passed in POCO - easier to extend and manage
	- Unit tests
		- Controller
			- Mocking - Show Moq, how it's used
			- Fluent Assertions - show what it can do and how it's useful - error message
			- Show what would it take to write such assertions by hand - commented code down in the file
		- NodeDAL
			- In-memory database for EF Core
		- NodePluginProviderTest
			- Mock file provider
			- Mock cache
		- FilesContentProviderTest
			- integration test, using real filesystem
			- Random folder
			- Cleanup after test
			- Theory - parametrized test
			- Use helper methods for repeated or complex setups
		- CacheTest
			- testing time-related logic

Client:
	- Show Angluar application 
		- TypeScript – why, benefits.
		- How to create - HowTo.txt
		- Startup.cs - app.UseSpa - serves Angular app, no need for .NET Controller
    - src/index.html
		- Angular page
	- src/app/app.component.ts
		- entry component
		- routing -> app.module.ts
	- src/app/home
		- list of nodes, show .html
		- DI of nodes service - app.module.ts -> providers
	- src/app/nodes.service.ts
		- DI of http - it's provided by HttpClientModule -> app.module.ts
		- DI of URL via @Inject
	- src/app/wizard
		- wizard component
		- does everything via wizard service
	- src/app/wizard-steps/define-node
		- show .html
		- mention how important is to not have any logic in template
		- show .ts, go through logic
		
	IndexController
		- NodesService - why to use services and not $http directly
		- Controller Tests
		- NodesServiceTest - testing $http
	- ? Wizard.html
    - ? WizardController
		- Tests
	- DefineNodeWizardStep view
		- How important is no logic in view for testability
	- RUN TESTS in browser and in Karma
	- BREAK SOME TEST, show debug in browser and in Karma
	- E2E tests
		- Page object pattern, benefits.
	- Running tests – Protractor
